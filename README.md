# mac-setup
This project is a set of scripts and config files to setup a new macOS device. It is based on my specific usage. Feel free to copy and adapt.

It uses Homebrew and has been tested on macOS Catalina (10.15).

Start the main script with **~/new_mac_install.sh** and grab a cup of :coffee:.
